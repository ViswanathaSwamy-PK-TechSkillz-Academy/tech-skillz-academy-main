To reuse the `layout.js` file from your `src/app` folder in the pages within the `pages` folder in a Next.js 14 project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Move or Import the Layout Component**: Ensure that the `layout.js` file exports a React component. If it's not already a React component, you will need to create one.

   Here is an example of what `layout.js` might look like:

   ```jsx
   // src/app/layout.js
   import React from "react";

   const Layout = ({ children }) => (
     <div>
       <header>{/* Header content */}</header>
       <main>{children}</main>
       <footer>{/* Footer content */}</footer>
     </div>
   );

   export default Layout;
   ```

2. **Wrap Pages with Layout**: To use this layout in your pages, you can create a custom `_app.js` file in the `pages` directory. This file allows you to customize the default Next.js App component, which wraps all the pages.

   Here's how you can do it:

   ```jsx
   // pages/_app.js
   import "../styles/globals.css"; // Import any global styles
   import Layout from "../src/app/layout"; // Adjust the path if necessary

   function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
     return (
       <Layout>
         <Component {...pageProps} />
       </Layout>
     );
   }

   export default MyApp;
   ```

3. **Check the Path**: Make sure the import path for the `Layout` component in `_app.js` is correct. Since your `layout.js` is in the `src/app` directory, the import statement should be:

   ```jsx
   import Layout from "../src/app/layout";
   ```

   Adjust the relative path if your directory structure is different.

4. **Run and Test Your Application**: After making these changes, run your Next.js application and check if the layout is correctly applied to all your pages. You can run the application using:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Explanation

- **`_app.js`**: This special file in the `pages` directory allows you to override the default App component in Next.js. By using this, you can wrap all your pages with a common layout.
- **`Layout` Component**: The `Layout` component wraps the `Component` prop, which represents the active page. This way, the layout is applied to all pages automatically.

By following these steps, you should be able to reuse your layout across all pages in your Next.js 14 project.
