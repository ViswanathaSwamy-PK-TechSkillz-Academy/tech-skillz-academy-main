# Data Structures and Algorithms

Certainly! Let's dive into the concepts of **Big O**, **Big Omega**, and **Big Theta** notations, along with some JavaScript examples.

1. **Big O (O)**:
   - **Definition**: Big O notation represents the **upper bound** on an algorithm's time complexity relative to its input size. It describes how the execution time grows as the input size increases.
   - **Mathematical Representation**: If a function `f(n)` describes the running time of an algorithm, we say that `f(n)` is `O(g(n))` if there exist positive constants `C` and `n‚ÇÄ` such that `0 ‚â§ f(n) ‚â§ Cg(n)` for all `n ‚â• n‚ÇÄ`.
   - **Example**: Consider linear search in an array. The worst-case time complexity is `O(n)` because the search time grows linearly with the input size.
   - **JavaScript Example**:

     ```javascript
     function linearSearch(arr, target) {
         for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
             if (arr[i] === target) {
                 return i; // Found at index i
             }
         }
         return -1; // Not found
     }
     ```

2. **Big Omega (Œ©)**:
   - **Definition**: Big Omega notation represents the **lower bound** on an algorithm's time complexity. It indicates the least amount of time required (best-case scenario).
   - **Mathematical Representation**: If `f(n)` is the running time of an algorithm, we say that `f(n)` is `Œ©(g(n))` if there exist positive constants `C` and `n‚ÇÄ` such that `0 ‚â§ Cg(n) ‚â§ f(n)` for all `n ‚â• n‚ÇÄ`.
   - **Example**: Binary search has a best-case time complexity of `Œ©(log n)` because it efficiently narrows down the search space by half with each iteration.
   - **JavaScript Example**:

     ```javascript
     function binarySearch(arr, target) {
         let left = 0;
         let right = arr.length - 1;
         while (left <= right) {
             const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
             if (arr[mid] === target) {
                 return mid; // Found at index mid
             } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
                 left = mid + 1;
             } else {
                 right = mid - 1;
             }
         }
         return -1; // Not found
     }
     ```

3. **Big Theta (Œò)**:
   - **Definition**: Big Theta notation represents the **tightest bound** on an algorithm's time complexity. It combines both the upper and lower bounds.
   - **Mathematical Representation**: If `f(n)` is both `O(g(n))` and `Œ©(g(n))`, we say that `f(n)` is `Œò(g(n))`.
   - **Example**: Merge sort has a time complexity of `Œò(n log n)` because it consistently performs well in both best and worst cases.
   - **JavaScript Example**:

     ```javascript
     function mergeSort(arr) {
         if (arr.length <= 1) {
             return arr;
         }
         const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
         const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
         const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));
         return merge(left, right);
     }

     function merge(left, right) {
         const result = [];
         let i = 0;
         let j = 0;
         while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
             if (left[i] < right[j]) {
                 result.push(left[i]);
                 i++;
             } else {
                 result.push(right[j]);
                 j++;
             }
         }
         return result.concat(left.slice(i), right.slice(j));
     }
     ```

Remember that these notations help us analyze and compare algorithms based on their efficiency. Feel free to use these examples in your notes! üöÄ¬π‚Å∏‚Åπ [^10^] ¬π¬π¬π¬≤

Certainly! Let's break down the time complexities and provide concise notes for each of these common notations:

1. **O(1) (Constant Time)**:
   - **Definition**: An algorithm has constant time complexity if its execution time remains the same regardless of the input size.
   - **Notes**: Algorithms with O(1) complexity are highly efficient. Examples include accessing an element in an array by index or performing basic arithmetic operations.
   - **JavaScript Example**:

     ```javascript
     function add(a, b) {
         return a + b; // O(1)
     }
     ```

2. **O(log n) (Logarithmic Time)**:
   - **Definition**: An algorithm has logarithmic time complexity if its execution time grows logarithmically with the input size.
   - **Notes**: Efficient algorithms like binary search fall into this category. Each step reduces the search space by half.
   - **JavaScript Example**:

     ```javascript
     function binarySearch(arr, target) {
         // Implementation provided earlier (O(log n))
     }
     ```

3. **O(n) (Linear Time)**:
   - **Definition**: An algorithm has linear time complexity if its execution time scales linearly with the input size.
   - **Notes**: Linear search and iterating through an array are examples of O(n) operations.
   - **JavaScript Example**:

     ```javascript
     function linearSearch(arr, target) {
         // Implementation provided earlier (O(n))
     }
     ```

4. **O(n^2) (Quadratic Time)**:
   - **Definition**: An algorithm has quadratic time complexity if its execution time grows quadratically with the input size.
   - **Notes**: Nested loops often lead to O(n^2) complexity. Examples include bubble sort and selection sort.
   - **JavaScript Example**:

     ```javascript
     function bubbleSort(arr) {
         const n = arr.length;
         for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
             for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                 if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                     [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
                 }
             }
         }
         return arr; // O(n^2)
     }
     ```
