## 1. What is .NET? and .NET History

> 1. .NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
> 1. With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.
> 1. .NET is supported by Microsoft. Microsoft ships official releases that are built and tested on Microsoft-maintained servers in Azure and supported just like any Microsoft product.

## Few Points

> 1. C# is a multi-paradigm programming language.
> 1. Program class is the entry point for every C# application and is required for every C# application.
> 1. The Main method is the entry point of a C# application. (There can only be one entry point in a C# program.)
> 1. .csproj file is the project file for C# projects. It contains all the information that's required to build your project.
> 1. .sln file is the solution file for Visual Studio. It contains information about one or more projects.

### 1.2. With Top Level Statements

> 1. Top level Statements, will create `Program` class, and `<Main>$()` method

```bash
dotnet new console -o demo2
```

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

[CompilerGenerated]
internal class Program
{
    private static void <Main>$(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
