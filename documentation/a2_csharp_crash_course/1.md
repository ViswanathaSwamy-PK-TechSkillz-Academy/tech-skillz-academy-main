## Few Commands

```bash
dotnet --version

#error version inside Program.cs

// <autogenerated />
global using global::System;
global using global::System.Collections.Generic;
global using global::System.IO;
global using global::System.Linq;
global using global::System.Net.Http;
global using global::System.Threading;
global using global::System.Threading.Tasks;

<ProjectName>.GlobalUsings.g.cs
```

## X. Few Points

> 1. Comments - Single line comments (//) and Multi-line comments (/*ddd*/).
> 1. Statements, Statements and Expressions (sum = num1 + num2; num1 + num2 is an expression). Statement terminates with semicolon (;).
> 1. Block of code is a set of statements that are grouped together using curly braces ({ and }). Block of code is also called as code block.
> 1. A namespace contains types like classes to group them together.
> 1. A class contains the members of an object, including methods.
> 1. A method contains statements that implement an action that an object can take.
> 1. Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. You cannot use a keyword as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, method, or class.
> 1. A variable is a name that you create to store a value. To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value. It should be in camelCase.
> 1. Global Usings - using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks;

## 1. What is .NET? and .NET History

> 1. .NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
> 1. With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.
> 1. .NET is supported by Microsoft. Microsoft ships official releases that are built and tested on Microsoft-maintained servers in Azure and supported just like any Microsoft product.

## Few Points

> 1. C# is a multi-paradigm programming language.
> 1. Program class is the entry point for every C# application and is required for every C# application.
> 1. C# is case sensitive. (C# is case sensitive. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently.)
> 1. The Main method is the entry point of a C# application. (There can only be one entry point in a C# program.)
> 1. Code Indentation is not required in C#. But it is recommended to use proper indentation to make the code more readable.
> 1. .csproj file is the project file for C# projects. It contains all the information that's required to build your project.
> 1. .sln file is the solution file for Visual Studio. It contains information about one or more projects.
> 1. Top-level statements are statements that aren't inside any type or namespace.
> 1. They are supported in Program.cs file. It should be as part of entry point and one application should have only one entry point.
> 1. The dot operator (.) is used to access members of a namespace, type, or object.
> 1. Demos -> ProgramStructureDemo.csproj.

## Next Session

> 1. Top-level statements are statements that aren't inside any type or namespace. They can be used to declare variables and their types, define functions, and define classes.

## 2. .NET History

> 1. Discussion and Demo

## 1. Console Application with and without Top Level Statements

> 1. Discussion and Demo

### 1.1 Without Top Level Statements

```bash
dotnet new console -o demo1 --use-program-main
```

![Demo 1 |150x150](./images/1/demo1.PNG)

### 1.2. With Top Level Statements

> 1. Top level Statements, will create `Program` class, and `<Main>$()` method

```bash
dotnet new console -o demo2
```

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

[CompilerGenerated]
internal class Program
{
    private static void <Main>$(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
