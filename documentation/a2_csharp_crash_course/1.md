## Few Commands

```bash
dotnet --version
```

## 1. What is .NET? and .NET History

> 1. .NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
> 1. With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.
> 1. .NET is supported by Microsoft. Microsoft ships official releases that are built and tested on Microsoft-maintained servers in Azure and supported just like any Microsoft product.

## Few Points

> 1. C# is a multi-paradigm programming language.
> 1. Program class is the entry point for every C# application and is required for every C# application.
> 1. C# is case sensitive. (C# is case sensitive. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently.)
> 1. The Main method is the entry point of a C# application. (There can only be one entry point in a C# program.)
> 1. Code Indentation is not required in C#. But it is recommended to use proper indentation to make the code more readable.
> 1. .csproj file is the project file for C# projects. It contains all the information that's required to build your project.
> 1. .sln file is the solution file for Visual Studio. It contains information about one or more projects.
> 1. Top-level statements are statements that aren't inside any type or namespace.
> 1. They are supported in Program.cs file. It should be as part of entry point and one application should have only one entry point.
> 1. The dot operator (.) is used to access members of a namespace, type, or object.
> 1. Demos -> ProgramStructureDemo.csproj.

## Next Session

> 1. Top-level statements are statements that aren't inside any type or namespace. They can be used to declare variables and their types, define functions, and define classes.

## 2. .NET History

> 1. Discussion and Demo

## 1. Console Application with and without Top Level Statements

> 1. Discussion and Demo

### 1.1 Without Top Level Statements

```bash
dotnet new console -o demo1 --use-program-main
```

![Demo 1 |150x150](./images/1/demo1.PNG)

### 1.2. With Top Level Statements

> 1. Top level Statements, will create `Program` class, and `<Main>$()` method

```bash
dotnet new console -o demo2
```

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

[CompilerGenerated]
internal class Program
{
    private static void <Main>$(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
